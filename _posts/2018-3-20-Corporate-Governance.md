 title: Corporate governance and performance of firms 
 ---
 
<p>This post is rightfully the first as it&rsquo;s about my master thesis paper, which is the study of corporate governance and how it affected performance of firms during the world financial crisis of 2007-2008, with a focus on emerging markets. &nbsp;</p>



<p>World financial crisis being an external shock, all firms struggled to maintain their financial performance. The overall aim was to look at corporate governance on firm level and country level and see</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>whether it has any effect on the prices of stocks during the crisis</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Whether firm is better &ldquo;on its own&rdquo; or CG policies also help it survive</p>
	</li>
</ul>
<p><br />
This research was based on <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2177841">this</a> paper by Ruben Enikopolov, Maria Petrova and my then scientific supervisor, Sergey Stepanov.</p>
