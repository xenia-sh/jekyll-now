<p>This post is rightfully the first as it&rsquo;s about my master thesis paper, which is the study of corporate governance and how it affected performance of firms during the world financial crisis of 2007-2008, with a focus on emerging markets. &nbsp;</p>



<p>World financial crisis being an external shock, all firms struggled to maintain their financial performance. The overall aim was to look at corporate governance on firm level and country level and see</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>whether it has any effect on the prices of stocks during the crisis</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Whether firm is better &ldquo;on its own&rdquo; or CG policies also help it survive</p>
	</li>
</ul>
<p>
This research was based on <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2177841">this</a> paper by Ruben Enikopolov, Maria Petrova and my then scientific supervisor, Sergey Stepanov.</p> </font>

<h3><strong>Corporate governance - what is it exactly?</strong></h3>
 <font size = "2">
<p>Many people seem to think that corporate governance is corporate culture, which is not the case. Academically it&rsquo;s defined as &ldquo;means of protecting the minor investors and ensuring they get a ROI&rdquo;. &nbsp;The three most prominent agencies measuring corporate governance all over the world are ISS, CLSA and Standard &amp; Poor&rsquo;s.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<img alt="RÃ©sultat de recherche d'images pour &quot;institutional shareholder services&quot;" src="https://www.issgovernance.com/file/2014/09/Header-Logo.png" />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/wBhkDWBr4Zu1WR9d0qtApr-XsVW4VgoiwMSnqtobiswguuJPrt94DrVUVTk7Hzdx0bghg5_noSRK9YzZ86cSMqA5pqp3WTv0fYwH7Ur1xBDQD1265gPbr0aZEqOXEjN4cNRh3TUw" style="height:52px; width:110px" />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/cF0ueamssyyqSicT3wnx5_0_lrRqCU35064WURcMaQRPLV1-iw0RmSsjGWp2RhvQjGmMtpYUCaX7rRR0lCfJ3-u8dN637cTyQ_CEMJ1u7tkm7j_TcW2zyxOMhs8x2OyLUahFbfWa" style="height:66px; width:132px" /><br />
Below is the table comparing their scores and methodologies. They&rsquo;re essentially questionnaires on a variety of subjects, upon which later the score is given. &nbsp;The one used by me was CLSA.&nbsp;</p></font>

<p><h3><strong>The data </strong></h3><br /><font size = "2">
All financial data was taken from Yahoo Finance and Thomson Reuters Datastream. The companies under examination were public, as only those have stocks trading at international exchange, and their financial information is available.<br />
<br />	
The countries taken into account were emerging markets, as on these the effect is more evident and less &ldquo;smoothed out&rdquo; or outweighed by other variables (as in Russia, for example, by corruption which makes measuring corporate governance extremely difficult). The ones under analysis were China, Hing Kong, India, Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand, EEMEA region and Latin America region.<br />	
<br />
Back then I did all the analysis and modeling in Eviews/Excel, and here is what one of my first results looked like:</p>
