<p>How, where, when and why clients choose financial products? This is a question managers, analysts and &ldquo;conseillers d&rsquo;affaires&rdquo; ask themselves all the time, as this is what the revenue will ultimately depend on. Equally important is whether the client will leave, at which moment and why (as then incentives to make him stay can be found). &nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Products&rdquo;, as in Santander case, will be the predicted variables, and these can be anything from specific card types, to insurances, to accounts, to services for business. <a href="https://particuliers.societegenerale.fr/tous_les_produits.html">Here</a> are examples of all products by a typical French bank. </p>

<p>It&rsquo;s good to know that there are three major client categories for banks in France - particuliers, professionnels and entreprises. There are also others depending on bank policy and specification.</font><br />

<h3><strong>The data </strong></h3><br />

Our train dataset is for year N while our test dataset is for the next year (N+1). Also, as will be seen by the data, the period for train is longer than for test.</font></p>
