### Interest for data science 
<font size = "2">
Professionally my work has always been related to data, recently - within the banking sector. <br /> 
Having looked at it from both enterprise (internal) and consultant (external) perspectives, I can say for certain that it's not only about analyzing the datasets themselves, but about gaining valuable insights in order to propose solutions. <br />
That is why, upon doing reporting, writing SQL scripts and creating Excel pivots, I became interested in DS/ML and started learning - it's challenging and technically complex, but ever more interesting for it.<br /></font>
