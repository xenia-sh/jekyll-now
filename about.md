### Interest for data science 
<font size = "2">
Professionally my work has always been related to data, recently - in banking/financial sector. <br /> 

Having looked at it from both enterprise (internal) and consultant (external) perspectives, I can say for certain that it's not only about analyzing the datasets themselves, but about gaining valuable insights in order to propose solutions. <br />

That is why, upon doing reporting, writing SQL scripts and creating Excel pivots, I started learning DS/ML - it's challenging and technically complex, but ever more interesting for it.<br /></font>
