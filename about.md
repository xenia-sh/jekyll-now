### Interest for data science 

Professionally my work has always been related to data, recently - within the banking sector.  
Having looked at it from both enterprise (internal) and consultant (external) perspectives, I can say for certain that it's not only about analyzing the datasets themselves, but about gaining valuable insights in order to propose solutions. 
That is why, upon doing reporting, writing SQL scripts and creating Excel pivots, I became interested in DS/ML and started learning - it's challenging and technically complex, but ever more interesting for it.
